Object-oriented programming is one of the most effective approaches to writing software.
In object-oriented programming you write classes that represent real-world things and situations, and you create objects 
based on these classes. When you write a class, you define the general behavior that a whole category of objects can have.

Making an object from a class is called instantiation, and you work with instances of a class.
capitalized names refer to classes in Python
--------------------------------------------------------------
class Dog:
  """A simple attempt to model a dog."""
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    """Initialize name and age attributes."""
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
    
  def sit(self):
    """Simulate a dog sitting in response to a command."""
    print(f"{self.name} is now sitting.")

  def roll_over(self):
    """Simulate rolling over in response to a command."""
    print(f"{self.name} rolled over!")

my_dog = Dog('Willie', 6)
your_dog = Dog('Lucy', 3)

print(f"My dog's name is {my_dog.name}.")
print(f"My dog is {my_dog.age} years old.")
my_dog.sit()

print(f"\nYour dog's name is {your_dog.name}.")
print(f"Your dog is {your_dog.age} years old.")
your_dog.sit()
--------------------------------------------------------------
My dog's name is Willie.
My dog is 6 years old.
Willie is now sitting.

Your dog's name is Lucy.
Your dog is 3 years old.
Lucy is now sitting.

A function that’s part of a class is a method. Everything you learned about functions applies to methods as well; 
the only practical difference for now is the way we’ll call methods.
The __init__() method at is a special method that Python runs automatically whenever we create a new instance based
on the Dog class. This method has two leading underscores and two trailing underscores, a convention that helps prevent 
Python’s default method names from conflicting with your method names.
The self parameter is required in the method definition, and it must come first before the other parameters.
