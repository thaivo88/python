Your program will use a web <i>application programming interface (API)</i> to automatically request specific information from a website—rather than entire pages—and then use that information to generate a visualization. Because programs written like this will always use current data to generate a visualization, even when that data might be rapidly changing, it will always be up to date.

Web API:

A web API is a part of a website designed to interact with programs. Those programs use very specific URLs to request certain information. This kind of request is called an API <i>call</i>. The requested data will be returned in an easily processed format, such as JSON or CSV.
